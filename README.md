# Demo dApps for Polymer

This repository contains multiple projects with sample cross-chain applications that leverage Polymer and IBC.

## Naming convention

Most projects will connect two IBC enabled contracts on remote chains. Therefore the project and folder could named as follows:
```
x-<contract-A>-<contract-B> 
```

For the commit message, start with the project name e.g.:
```bash
x-<contract-A>-<contract-B>: add IBC callbacks to contract to implement IbcReceiver interface
```
